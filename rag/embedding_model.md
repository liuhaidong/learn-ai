# ‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define your retrieval goal

Before picking a model, clarify:

* **Domain**: Is it general (e.g., Wikipedia-like), or specialized (e.g., medical, legal, technical)?
* **Granularity**: Are your documents small snippets, paragraphs, or long documents?
* **Precision vs recall**: Do you care more about always retrieving relevant info (high recall), or avoiding irrelevant info (high precision)?

---

# ‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Consider embedding model capabilities

## ‚úîÔ∏è Domain coverage

* **General-purpose embeddings** (e.g., OpenAI text-embedding-3-large, Cohere Embed v3, or BAAI/bge-large-en from Hugging Face) work well if your content is broad.
* **Domain-specific embeddings** (e.g., BioBERT for biomedical, or custom fine-tuned embeddings) are better if your knowledge base uses specialized terms.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Language support

* If your knowledge base is multilingual, choose a multilingual model (e.g., multilingual versions of BGE, LaBSE, or multilingual Cohere).

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Model size and cost

* Larger models (e.g., OpenAI text-embedding-3-large, BGE large) often perform better but are more expensive and slower.
* Smaller models (e.g., MiniLM, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from SBERT) are fast and cheap but may sacrifice accuracy.

# ‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate embedding quality (semantic similarity)

A good practice is to **evaluate retrieval quality on your own data**, rather than only looking at leaderboard scores.

### Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pick a representative set of queries and expected correct documents (gold set).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Compute embeddings of your documents.
3Ô∏è‚É£ For each query, embed it and compute top-K retrieved documents.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate metrics such as:

* **Recall\@K** (are correct docs among the top K results?)
* **Precision\@K**
* **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**
* **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)**

# ‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Try existing high-performing choices

Here‚Äôs a list of popular embedding models you can start with (and then benchmark):

| Model                                               | Advantages                                                              | Typical use cases                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI text-embedding-3-large**                   | Very strong general performance, especially on English and cross-domain | General knowledge base, support bots           |
| **BAAI bge-large-en/v1.5**                          | Open-source, great for English, strong on semantic search tasks         | Enterprise internal KB, open-source preference |
| **Cohere Embed v3**                                 | Good multilingual support, high quality                                 | Multi-language KB, customer support            |
| **Sentence Transformers (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2)** | Open-source, fast, flexible                                             | Smaller KB, quick prototyping                  |
| **MiniLM-based models**                             | Lightweight, very fast, lower cost                                      | Mobile, edge deployments                       |
| **Custom fine-tuned model**                         | Tailored, best for niche domains                                        | Highly specialized technical content           |

# ‚úÖ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Consider re-ranking or hybrid approaches

Sometimes initial embeddings alone are not enough. You can:

* Use embeddings to get top-20 results
* Then use **cross-encoders** or LLM re-ranking to reorder them based on relevance (e.g., Cohere re-ranker, OpenAI rerank endpoint, or custom LLM-based scoring)

---

# ‚úÖ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure and cost considerations

* **Latency**: Can your model handle batch queries with acceptable speed?
* **Cost**: Will you run it on your own GPU or use API calls?
* **Scalability**: Does it support tens of millions of vectors?

# ‚úÖ üß™ Example process for choosing

```
1Ô∏è‚É£ Collect 50‚Äì100 real user queries and expected correct documents.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate embeddings from BGE-large, OpenAI text-embedding-3-large, and one fast baseline (e.g., MiniLM).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Compute metrics: Recall@5, MRR, nDCG.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Pick top performer (balance quality vs latency vs cost).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Optionally fine-tune or add re-ranker.
