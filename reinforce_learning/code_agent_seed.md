an ai agent parse requiremnt doc(pages,docx,pdf), tag each section of doc for specific domain, then load related project code files, find out which config file(which rows values), code files are from coressponding which section of doc, then veifify and check the codes are aligned with docs. after build basic agent workflow, need continue use reinforcement learning to promote the agent ability to solve handle variant doc structure and learn how to write code from doc. please adive detail plan from the world state difinition, collect trajectory data, action space, policy definition, model architect for reinforce learning training, reward function, goal setting, training process.
