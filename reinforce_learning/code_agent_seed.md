# phase1
an ai agent parse requiremnt doc(pages,docx,pdf),
tag each section of doc for specific domain,
then load related project code files, 
find out which config file(which rows values) with code files are from coressponding which section of doc, 
then verifify and check the codes are aligned with docs.
# phase2
appley phas1 analysis on 2 version doc and earlier code repo, 
comapre the doc diff changes, 
use diff changes drive code changes on code repo
# phase 3
after build basic agent workflow and all atom actions, 
use reinforcement learning to promote the agent ability to solve handle variant doc structure ,
learn how to generate code from doc or doc changes. 
please adive detail plan from the world state difinition, collect trajectory data, action space, policy definition, model architect for reinforce learning training, reward function, goal function setting, runnable training process.
